## 🚀 About Me
I am a final-year Robotics Engineering student with a strong passion for embedded systems, robotics, and automotive technologies. My academic background and projects have given me solid skills in programming (Python, C/C++), embedded development, computer vision, and control of robotic systems. I am particularly interested in ADAS and autonomous systems, where I aim to apply my knowledge to real-world applications. I am currently seeking a PFE internship opportunity to contribute to innovative and challenging projects while further developing my expertise in robotics and embedded systems.
